Request the endpoints and stuff from Shoumit and Nilesh



Start work on PSUI Overview - Cable Labs, DOCSIS, Partial Service


My requirements
What do you intend to build - what are they using this for
How are you interacting with this? - do you just want to use it or do other stuff
Who's using this? - Just Service Assurance or field ops, etc.
What data do you want? A Graph? Just seeing the data and being able to sort?
Track the number of outages over time like a dashboard


access data by siteid, accountnbr, devicetype, partial_svc_channel_status, Maybe mac_address
sort data by

display it like

using what service (managed or self built)

assumptions
data is accessible via Enterprise Kafka

dependencies
Mosaic or other data

Design
How will it operate, where will it operate - Cloud, constraints

11/19
Consumption of data from Kafka topics
Dss test instances

Set the linker function

lambda timesout on 15 minutes

Use EC2 - versatile

prod aws still waiting on vanity - internal-0f215597-dssfusion-ingress-abe8-68259748.us-east-1.elb.amazonaws.com
non prod aws vanity- https://nonprod.dss.fusion.cox.net/rest/opm/version2/getOpmModel?Service=transport&assetCategory=cbs&neType=7210%20SAS-MXP-22F-2C-4SFP&alarmSeverity=Major&alarmCondition=InterfaceDown

Seeing as how we'll be working from home now until early june, 

Are all of these parameters being utilized?
For Angelise and Raghav, what are the most important parameters to include.

a.	URL – what are the most important URLs that an external team would need?
b.	API Response – REST and SOAP – are both of these currently being utilized?
c.	Is there no request needed?

Network connectivty - problem for each tool

How I get a 500 internal server error?


explain consumer service - when I finish the design
explain and make what I did seem fantastic with lots of simplistic explanations
This is for upper level management



Seperate word document for requirements and design for partial service UI

Next steps incorporate revisions, change ppt to Cox design, host fusion documentation

angelise is supposed to send me something similar to my fusion documentation for one of the teams

Hosting:
sharepoint
swagger
Google Docs?
Google Drive?
Box
Dropbox
OneDrive

Need to learn for EC2 Instance
splunk
configure http, ports, etc.

how we plan to connect data
kafka sink connectors
how we get data to splunk
Enterprise Kafka - Is this confluent?
Kerberos


login to splunk, ask him for the credentials, and download via command line
wget

untar it tar -xvzf name-of-file

start splunk ./splunk start

Splunk will start a web server to be enterer, enter the Public IP address of the instance:8000 ex. http://1.2.3.4:8000

login using the admin user and pass you configured for splunk

Configure ports






DHCP - dynamic host configuration protocol - network management protocol used to automate the process of configuring devices on IP networks allowing them to use any communication protocol based on UDP or TCP. so they can communicate with other IP networks


TFTP - trivial file transfer protocol - allows a client to get or put a file onto a remote host. reads or writes files from or to a remote host.


ToD - Time of Day Server


Router - forwards data packets between network using information in its routing table or routing policy. concerned with the actual data itself coming to and from the internet


Switch - connects devices on a computer network to receive and forward data to the destination device. Manage the flow of data across a network by moving packets to the devices to where they are supposed to go to. concerned with connecting devices on a network


CMTS - cable modem termination system - provide high speed data services to cable subscribers


HFC Network - hybrid fiber coaxial - broadband network that comes optical fiber and coaxial cable - Do we use a HFC Network>?







dev team
username - is it mosaic
topic names
key tabs
certificates 
krb5.conf
environment - qa or dev

PUT IT ON A FILESHARE and then download it from there

On demand linux Request Linux vm, request 16 cvores, 64 g ram, 256


spell out the abbreviations - SOAP, REST, OPM for the common users like UNO, FNT, etc.
go into details

switch the description with the details

I like directness

"\"accountnumber\"\s:\s\"(?P<accountnumber>\d+)\"[\s\S]*\"siteid\"\s:\s\"(?P<siteid>\d+)\"[\s\S]*\""

^\{'(?P<siteid>[a-z]+)[^,\n]*,\s+'(?P<accountnumber>[a-z]+)(?:[^ \n]* ){8}'(?P<devicetype>\w+)(?:[^'\n]*'){8}(?P<partial_svc_channel_status>[^']+)

[\s\S]*\"



list by current 6 hour period so update at 12 6 12 6 for the current day


earliest=-1d@d+24h

map for siteid - advanced
count for siteid and percentage - I need the actual number of accounts in that site



have the screenshots for the dashboard update the deck (not pertinent this year) 


work with Nilesh tell them to do a push

acknowledge review - 3/31
check cox comp tomorrow
team member presentations based on ideas to help the team 2-5 mins - Can use Jira
Talk to angelise before I present

Salary increase begins in mid to late march -3/20 paid on 4/9
get the money two weeks after it starts
new salary is 7,210

target percentage will go up if you get a promotion
Currently it's 6%

Care about the rating when you go for the promotion as you 

prob a candidate for promotion in 2022

contact angelise when that's done have something middle of march 

respond to Neil

For presentation:
Jira or another PM tool - can have other teams open jira tickets, but you want it to be private so I'll have to see how that works but maybe how kim gets the ECR's and all that that's how it can be managed. In our current implementation it can be used, but if we wanted it even better with everyone always having work and knowing what they're doing we'd have to start doing for sprint planning
Documentation for Fusion or Mosaic
Partial service dashboard


Ask Angelise about acknowledgement


spring break time

put subj lines your name ooo

She wants a way to report data out

Goals - take what's posted from the team meeting. Ask Raghav about how he does the CTA goals. Mosaic Delivery - will be working on mosaic and fusion. ask about what items I'll be working on and how that maps to the Cox focus areas. Put timeline not past by July for RToc, Denodo by EOY, Stage/Unstage guardrails Q2 - have draft by next week
Nilesh hit me - is this related to Yogesh. Is there any permissions I need
Raghav added me to CTA - askk him about when to be on the meetings
Does this have anything to do with Denodo

I need to hit Raghav about the SPlunk
Test information with Debolina - Angelise remind her in 2 weeks from 3/12
Talk to Raghav about that project he mentioned
