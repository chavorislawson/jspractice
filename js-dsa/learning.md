# Notes on what I learned in FreecodeCamp

Let's not try to get in the weeds of the syntax. I think that's what I'm doing. Just focus on what's actually happening when the syntax is used, other than trying to remember what the syntax is.

## Javascript DSA Section

There are so many ways to define a function - anonymous functions, regular, functions in objects(declarative functions), arrow function
how to access an array and objects elements - destructuring assignment
var, let, const
Object.freeze
template literals
object literal
rest parameter
spread operator
creating objects - class, from variables
placement of semi-colons - after objects without classes, after variable declarations, sometimes the semi-colons don't really interfere with the code if you miss it out
interoperability of using single and double quotes. Only use backticks when using template literals
module script
promise

## OOP

Prototypes and constructors - prototypes are like abstract classes in Jav
Mixin - is a function to give objects certain methods instead of having unrelated objects inherit the same supertype to obtain that method. Like a abstract in Java, but this just deals with functions, Where as the prototypes and abstract class can give any attribute.
Modules and IIFE's (Immediately Invoked Function Expression) - modules is just an object and can be used to group IIFE's which are just function that execute immediately.
