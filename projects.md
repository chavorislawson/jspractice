# Javascript DSA Projects

The objective is to do all these projects "back-end" code first and then create a UI to support the project. This makes the projects "full-stack", gives me experience with creating front ends and UI's, and allows for later customization down the road. 
I will be starting off with simple HTML and CSS, but then I'll be migrating over to using frontend frameworks such as React and Angular, and incorporating more advanced technologies like Node.js to support API's.

## Palindrome Checker

function palindrome(str) {
  str.lower;
  str.strip;
  //just working now on putting all the strings in the same case
  //and removing all of the non alpha-numeric characters
  for(var i=0;i<str.length/2;i++){
    if(str[i]!==str[str.length-1-i]){
      return false;
    }
  }
  return true;
}

palindrome("eye");
